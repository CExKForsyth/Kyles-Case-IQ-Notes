# How to Import a New Language from XLSX into v9.5.1

## Part 1: Local Setup

#### Step 1:
Set up your application normally on your local machine.

#### Step 2:
in the script directory of your config, create a file called `import-language.js`
in the script directory, also create a new directory called `language-files`

#### Step 3:
In the import-language.js file, paste [this script](#)

#### Step 4: 
Ensure that the names for each variable match what's coming in on your new translation file.

#### Step 5: 
In the language-files directory, add the xlsx file of new translations


## Part 2: Get the sys_translation Template

#### Step 1:
Run your local environment, and navigate to Settings/System/Languages

#### Step 2:
If you see your language in the grid, click on it, then click Delete, to remove all current translations for that language.
Then, select Add Language, and select your language again to add it.
> This will generate a full standard set of translations for your language (they will still be english at this time)

#### Step 3:
Navigate to Settings/System/Configuration Export & Import

#### Step 4:
In the grid, tick the box for `Translations`, then click export and export that file. 

#### Step 5:
Once downloaded, unzip it, and place the csv in your project in the script/language-files directory.

#### Step 6:
In your `import-language.js` script, ensure the variable for templateFilePath matches the name of this file. 

## Part 3: Adding the Language

#### Step 1:
In your local terminal, run `node script/import-language.js`

#### Step 2:
Once completed, a new directory with a file called `sys_translation.csv` should be saved to your desktop.

#### Step 3:
In your application, once again navigate to Settings/System/Configuration Export & Import.

This time, import this new file. It should overwrite all translations, including the new language translations with the updated values.

#### Step 4:
Change your user profile language to the new language, hard refresh and clear cache and test.
